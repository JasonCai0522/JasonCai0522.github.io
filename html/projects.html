    <p style = "font-size:1.5vw; text-align: left;">During my first year of learning how to program, I recreated the popular pen-and-paper game “Hangman” digitally through Python. Later, I utilized the python library Tkinter to add a visual interface for the user to interact with. Despite this project not being particularly complicated or difficult, I feel like I learned a lot about problem solving with Python and the thought process behind writing code.</p>

      <h2 style = "font-size: 2.5vw;">2-Wheeled Robot</h2>
      <p style =" font-size:1.5vw; text-align: right;">Last year, I built a 2-wheeled robot in an electronics class. Then, I programmed simple logic into the robot so it would be able to navigate through a maze with ultrasonic sensors. To do the programming, I utilized basic C++. Finally, I attached a speaker onto the robot and programmed a song for it to play while it ran. From this project, I gained a rudimentary understanding of how some languages other than Python may look and how to incorporate programs into real-world machines.</p>

  <section style = "margin: 0 ;">
    <p style = "font-size: 1.5vw; width:80%;">This year, I created a portfolio website to display my personal projects and information. To create the website, I used HTML and a CSS sheet to stylize my work. I also included a form on the website that could take in responses and store them in a spreadsheet. To add functionality to my form, I used Javascript to check if the submissions were valid. From this project, some things I learned about was writing in HTML as well as website hosting.</p>
