    <h2 style = "font-size:2.25vw; text-align: center;">Interests</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw; width:60%; margin-left: 20%;">Some of my interests are math, physics, and programming. I’ve been interested in math ever since I was young, and I loved competing in various different competitions. As I got older, I began gaining an interest towards physics and programming. Some of my less academic interests are badminton and music. I’ve played badminton since the 5th grade and have consistently competed on my school's team. Music is another topic I’ve been interested in ever since a young age. I first began learning music through piano in the fourth grade. Now, I play piano, flute, baritone saxophone, and tenor saxophone.</p>
